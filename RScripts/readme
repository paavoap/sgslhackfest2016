The DashDB R Rest API:https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/wp-content/themes/projectnext-clouddata/dashDB/
The BuildModel.r load all the data from DB and build a NN model for a grid. 
The getPrediction.r load a model(hard coded for now), takes Time of Day as argument to get the prediction.


Refer to the CURL script for calling the REST API to execute the "getPrediction.r" script, the arguments should contain the JS time, lat, lon. E.g.
{
  "arguments": [
    "\"Sat Aug 06 2016 7:30:34 GMT+0800 (Malay Peninsula Standard Time)\",103.964567, 1.335705"
  ]
}

For coordinate with a valid model, this is the response:

{"message":"NONE","result":{"timestamp":"20160815 14:44:34 UTC","rScriptError":"Loading required package: RODBC\nLoading required package: ibmdbR\nLoading required package: methods\nLoading required package: MASS\nLoading required package: grDevices\nLoading required package: graphics\nLoading required package: stats\nLoading required package: utils\nLoading required package: Matrix\nLoading required package: arules\n\nAttaching package: \u2018arules\u2019\n\nThe following objects are masked from \u2018package:base\u2019:\n\n    %in%, write\n\nLoading required package: rpart\nLoading required package: rpart.plot\nLoading required package: ggplot2\nLoading required package: grid\n","rScriptOutput":"          [,1]\n[1,] 0.5228787\n","filename":"getPrediction.r"},"errorMessageCode":"NONE","resultCode":"SUCCESS"}

where "rScriptOutput":"          [,1]\n[1,] 0.5228787\n"
contains the prediction 0.5228787. For coordinate without a valid model, a prediction of -1 is returned.
